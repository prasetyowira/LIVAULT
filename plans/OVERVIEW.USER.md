# 👋 Welcome to LiVault

**LiVault** helps you secure your most precious digital data — passwords, letters, and important files — and pass them on to the right people when the time comes.

---

## 🧭 What is LiVault?

LiVault is a **decentralized digital legacy vault** built on blockchain. You can:
- Store encrypted documents and private notes
- Set rules like “unlock after 1 year” or “needs 2 heirs’ approval”
- Invite trusted **heirs** and **witnesses**
- Pay once, keep forever (no subscription!)

---

## 👥 Who's Involved?

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|------------------|
| **You (Vault Owner)** | Create vault, set rules, upload content |
| **Heirs** | Get invited, approve unlock, access content after unlock |
| **Witnesses** | Optional. Can trigger unlock if owner is inactive |
| **Admin (System)** | Only sees usage stats — never your data |

---

## 🔐 How It Works

1. **Create Your Vault**
   - Choose storage plan
   - Set unlock rules (e.g., 2 heirs, 1 witness)
   - Pay once using ICP or crypto via ChainFusion

2. **Upload Your Content**
   - Files (PDF, JPG, DOCX, etc.)
   - Passwords or secrets
   - Personal letters to loved ones

3. **Invite Heirs and Witnesses**
   - One-time invite link or QR code
   - They log in, set a passphrase, and receive a secure key

4. **Unlock When the Time Comes**
   - Unlock conditions met (e.g. owner inactive + heirs approved)
   - Heirs download your encrypted legacy

---

## 📋 Content Types You Can Store

- ✉️ Personal Letters
- 🔐 Passwords or Secrets
- 📄 Documents (Wills, IDs, etc.)
